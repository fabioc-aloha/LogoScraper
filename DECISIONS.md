# Architectural Decisions

## 1. Code Organization

### Implementation
- **Module Structure**: Services for external integrations, utilities for common functions
- **Centralized Configuration**: Single config.py for all settings
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive code documentation and README
- **Modular Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for logo sources

### Pending Improvements
- Additional plugin discovery mechanism
- Service health monitoring and performance dashboards

### Test Suite
- **Input Service Tests**: Validation of data filtering and column normalization
- **Logo Generation Tests**: End-to-end validation of the generation pipeline
- **Multilingual Text Tests**: Special test cases for challenging scripts and languages

## 2. Storage Structure

### Implementation
```
C:\Data\
    ├── logos\     # Processed company logos
    ├── temp\      # Temporary files
    └── input\     # Input Excel files
```

- **Automated Management**: Temp file cleanup with user confirmation
- **Consistent Access**: Standard paths through configuration
- **Clear Organization**: Separate directories for different data types

## 3. Logo Processing Pipeline

### Implementation
- **Primary Source**: Clearbit Logo API
- **Fallback**: Default Logo Generator with text-based company logos
