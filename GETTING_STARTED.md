## üìã What You'll Need

Before starting, make sure you have:
- **Python 3.7 or higher** ([Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **An Excel file** with your company data
- **Basic command line knowledge** (don't worry, we'll guide you!)

## üìä Preparing Your Data

Your Excel file needs these columns:

| Column Name | Required? | Description | Example |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `tpid` | ‚úÖ Yes | Unique ID for each company | 12345 |
| `crmaccountname` | ‚úÖ Yes | Company name | "Microsoft Corporation" |
| `websiteurl` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional | Company website | "https://www.microsoft.com" |
| `country` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional | Country code | "US" |

**Example Excel structure:**
```
tpid    | crmaccountname      | websiteurl              | country
12345   | Microsoft Corp      | https://microsoft.com   | US  
67890   | Toyota Motor Co     | https://toyota.com      | JP
```

> **üí° Tip:** The scraper is smart - it can find logos even without website URLs!

## üìÅ Finding Your Results

After completion, check your output folder:
```
Your Output Folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 12345.png          # Logo for company 12345
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 67890.png          # Logo for company 67890
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...more logos...
```

Plus these files in the `temp/` folder:
- `logo_scraper.log` - Detailed processing log
- `Companies_enriched_[timestamp].xlsx` - Your original data with results

## üõë Common First-Time Issues

### "Command not found" or "python is not recognized"
**Solution:** Python isn't installed or not in your PATH
- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"

### "No such file or directory"  
**Solution:** File path is wrong
- Use the full path to your file
- On Windows, use `\` or `/` in paths
- Make sure the file actually exists!

### "Permission denied"
**Solution:** File is locked or folder isn't writable
- Close Excel if your input file is open
- Make sure you can write to the output folder
- Try running as administrator (Windows)

## üéõÔ∏è Useful Options for Beginners

### Start Small (Test with fewer companies)
```bash
python main.py --input "file.xlsx" --output "logos" --batch-size 10
```

### Clean Start (Clear previous attempts)
```bash
python main.py --clean --input "file.xlsx" --output "logos"
```

### See What's Happening (Debug mode)
```bash
python main.py --log-level DEBUG --input "file.xlsx" --output "logos"
```

### Filter by Country (Process only US companies)
```bash
python main.py --filter "country=US" --input "file.xlsx" --output "logos"
```
