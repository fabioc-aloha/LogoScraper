# Project Learnings

This document captures key learnings, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented during the development of the Company Logo Scraper project.

## Issues Encountered and Solutions

### 1. Multilingual Text Rendering

**Issue:** Rendering company names with non-Latin scripts (CJK, Arabic, Cyrillic, etc.) produced inconsistent or unreadable results.

**Solution:**
- Implemented sophisticated script detection algorithm that analyzes Unicode character properties
- Created a multi-tiered font fallback system with script-specific font selection
- Added special handling for challenging scripts like Turkish and Korean
- Developed proportional line spacing for better readability across writing systems

**What Worked:**
- Unicode character property analysis proved reliable for script detection
- Separating Korean from other CJK scripts dramatically improved Korean text rendering
- Using system fonts with broad character coverage improved compatibility

**What Didn't Work:**
- Initially tried a simpler script detection based only on Unicode blocks, which failed for mixed-script text
- Single font approach couldn't handle the diversity of writing systems
- Fixed line spacing was problematic for scripts with different vertical metrics

### 2. Image Processing and Standardization

**Issue:** Source logos varied greatly in quality, format, and dimensions, making standardization challenging.

**Solution:**
- Implemented aspect ratio preservation with centered positioning
- Used LANCZOS resampling for high-quality resizing
- Added transparent background handling
- Implemented quality checks to reject low-resolution sources
- Set upper limit on upscaling ratio to prevent blurry outputs

**What Worked:**
- The 512Ã—512 output size provided good balance between quality and file size
- LANCZOS resampling produced cleaner results than bicubic or bilinear
- Aspect ratio preservation maintained brand identity better than stretching

**What Didn't Work:**
- Initial attempts with rounded corners caused inconsistencies with certain logo types
- Early versions attempted too much image enhancement, damaging logo quality
- Plain white backgrounds performed better than gradient or textured backgrounds

### 3. Performance Optimization

**Issue:** Processing large datasets (10,000+ companies) was initially slow and memory-intensive.

**Solution:**
- Implemented batch processing with configurable batch size
- Added multiprocessing with appropriate worker pool management
- Introduced caching of failed domains to avoid redundant processing
- Optimized HTTP connections with session reuse and connection pooling

**What Worked:**
- Default batch size of 300 provided good balance of memory usage vs. parallelism
- Worker pool sized to (CPU cores - 1) provided optimal resource utilization
- Caching failed domains reduced unnecessary network requests

**What Didn't Work:**
- Initially tried thread-based parallelism, which didn't scale well due to GIL limitations
- Early attempts with very large batches (1000+) caused memory pressure and swapping
- First implementation didn't properly clean up resources between batches

### 4. Error Handling and Recovery

**Issue:** Network failures and API timeouts caused process interruptions and data loss.

**Solution:**
- Implemented exponential backoff retry mechanism for transient failures
- Created detailed progress tracking with resume capability
- Added comprehensive logging with appropriate error categorization
- Implemented graceful shutdown handling

**What Worked:**
- Exponential backoff with 3 retries resolved ~80% of transient failures
- Progress tracking using JSON files provided simple but reliable state preservation
- Per-company error handling prevented single failures from affecting entire batches

**What Didn't Work:**
- Early implementations had overly aggressive timeouts (5s), causing unnecessary failures
- Initial retry mechanism used fixed intervals, which was ineffective for rate-limiting
- First version lacked proper signal handling for graceful interruptions

### 5. Documentation and Maintainability

**Issue:** The codebase grew complex with sophisticated algorithms that were difficult to understand and maintain.

**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive README.md with usage instructions and feature descriptions
- Developed DECISIONS.md to document architectural choices and rationales
- Added detailed algorithm documentation with explanations of key techniques
- Improved configuration documentation with parameter descriptions and recommendations
- Created proper test documentation

**What Worked:**
- Separating documentation into README (usage) and DECISIONS (architecture) improved clarity
- Adding algorithm documentation with rationales helped explain complex code
- Detailed configuration comments made tuning parameters more accessible

**What Didn't Work:**
- Early documentation focused too much on code structure and not enough on algorithms
- Initial comments lacked context about why certain approaches were chosen
- Test documentation was initially missing, making it difficult to verify changes

## Key Learnings

### Development Approach

1. **Iterative Refinement:** Starting with a minimal working solution and iteratively improving it was more effective than attempting a complete solution from the start.

2. **Parallel Processing:** For batch operations, a properly tuned multiprocessing approach with appropriate batch sizes dramatically outperforms sequential processing.

3. **Error Tolerance:** Building systems that expect and handle failures gracefully is essential for large-scale processing operations.

4. **Centralized Configuration:** Keeping all configurable parameters in a single, well-documented file greatly simplified maintenance and tuning.

### Technical Insights

1. **Image Processing:** 
   - Preserving aspect ratio is generally more important than filling the entire canvas
   - Quality control checks (minimum size, maximum upscaling) are essential for consistent outputs

2. **Multilingual Support:**
   - Script detection requires sophisticated Unicode analysis, not just character ranges
   - Different scripts need different rendering approaches and font selection strategies
   - Line spacing and vertical positioning need script-specific adjustments

3. **HTTP Handling:**
   - Connection pooling and session reuse significantly improve performance for multiple requests
   - Exponential backoff is essential for handling rate limits and transient failures
   - Configurable timeouts are important for different network conditions

4. **Documentation:**
   - Algorithm documentation is as important as API documentation
   - Explaining the "why" behind design choices is critical for maintainability
   - Configuration parameters need clear explanations of impacts and recommended values

## Future Improvements

Based on our learnings, these areas would benefit from future improvement:

1. **Error Analytics:** Implementing error trend analysis and impact assessment to identify systematic issues

2. **Advanced Text Processing:** Adding fuzzy matching for company names and domain name inference

3. **Service Monitoring:** Adding health checks and performance dashboards for better operational visibility

4. **Additional Logo Sources:** Implementing more fallback sources to further improve success rates

5. **Dynamic Resource Management:** Automatically adjusting batch sizes and worker counts based on system load and available resources

6. **Font Management:** Implementing a more robust font discovery and management system, possibly with downloadable fonts for better multilingual support

7. **Incremental Updates:** Adding capabilities to efficiently update only changed or new company logos rather than full reprocessing

# LEARNINGS

## 2025-05-19: Improving Robustness in Logo Scraping

- **Domain Input is Messy:** Real-world company data often contains malformed, concatenated, or otherwise invalid website domains. A robust cleaning function is essential to maximize successful logo retrievals.
- **Comprehensive Cleaning Pays Off:** Removing extraneous characters, handling multiple delimiters, and stripping common prefixes like `www.` greatly increases the number of valid domains processed.
- **Diagnostics are Critical:** Detailed logging (including HTTP status and response content for failures) is invaluable for diagnosing why logo fetches fail and for continuous improvement.
- **Graceful Degradation:** By only failing on truly invalid domains, the pipeline can process more companies successfully and provide better coverage.
- **Documentation Matters:** Keeping documentation and code comments up-to-date with actual workflow and logic changes helps future maintainers and users understand the system.
