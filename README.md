## ðŸš€ Quick Start
1. **Set up your environment:**
   ```powershell
   ./prepare_env.bat
   ```
   This creates a virtual environment and installs all dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.
2. **Prepare your data:**
   - Excel file with columns: `ID`, `CompanyName`, `WebsiteURL` (optional), `Country` (optional)
3. **Run the scraper:**
   ```powershell
   python main.py --input "Companies.xlsx" --output "logos"
   ```
4. **Need help?**
   ```powershell
   python main.py --help
   ```

## Usage Examples
```bash
# Filter by country and process specific companies
python main.py --filter "Country=US" --id 12345 --batch-size 150 --max-processes 4

# Process only a subset of companies by ID
python main.py --id 12345 --id 67890

# Change batch size and parallelism
python main.py --batch-size 200 --max-processes 8
```

---

## Configuration
- Edit `src/config.py` for permanent defaults (logo size, batch size, etc.)
- CLI arguments always override config file values for a single run

---

## How It Works
1. **Reads your Excel file** and loads company data
2. **Filters companies** based on CLI options (IDs, country, etc.)
3. **Checks output folder** for existing logo files and skips already-processed companies
4. **Downloads logos** from multiple sources (Clearbit, favicon, or generates a fallback)
5. **Standardizes images** to consistent PNG format and size
6. **Saves results** to the output folder and updates progress
7. **Handles errors** gracefully and continues processing
